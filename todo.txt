Experiments:

1. Dataset:
	1.1 p2p-Gnutella 04
	1.2 p2p-Gnutella 24
	1.3 email-EU-core
	1.4 Twitter???????????????????????????????? ( Time limit exceeded)


2. Simulation:
	2.1 Computation limitations while running the simulation with a large number of triangles (> 10 million).



Theory:

1. Parallel best response algorithm does not always give a NE

2. Determining whether there exists a NE with exaclty K nodes in state 1 (anti-vaccine) is NP-Hard

3. Create a timeline for this project

4. Literature review????????????????????????????


Paper:

1. Restructuring the paper
